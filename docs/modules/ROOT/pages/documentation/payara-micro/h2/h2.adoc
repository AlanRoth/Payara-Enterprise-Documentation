= H2 Database

In Payara Micro 5, Derby will be removed as default database and replaced with 
H2. Similar to Derby, H2 is a Java based Database. More info can be found

== Why was Derby Removed?
In terms of performance, Derby is one of the slowest  embedded databases as  
compared to H2, PostgresSQL, HSQLDB. H2 also has a smaller disk footprint; the 
size of a jar file is around 1.5 MB. This should have positive effect on Payara 
Micro's boot time.
