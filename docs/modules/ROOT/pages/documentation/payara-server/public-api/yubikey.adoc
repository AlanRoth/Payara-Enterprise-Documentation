= Yubikey Support

_Since Payara Server 5.182_

The Payara API provides a way to authenticate with Yubikey using the `@YubikeyIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation. This works in the same way as other identity stores in the Java EE Security API.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The Yubikey identity store is defined through the `@YubikeyIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation. Specifying this in a valid place as defined by the Security API will create the identity store. Often this may mean that any class is a valid position. 

WARNING: This authentication mechanism currently supports cloud-based Yubikey authentication servers only.

[[usage-example]]
=== Example

The following code sample illustrates how to configure Yubikey support:

[source, java]
----
@YubikeyIdentityStoreDefinition(yubikeyAPIKey="qwertyuiop1234567890", yubikeyAPIClientID=98765)
public class ApplicationConfiguration {

}
----


[[configuration]]
== Configuration

The `@YubikeyIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation has several configuration attributes. These refer to the API access credentials from Yubico.

IMPORTANT: One of `yubikeyAPIClientID`, `yubikeyAPIClientIDExpression` or a MicroProfile Configuration settings is mandatory for the feature to work correctly.

.Configuration Options
|===
| Option | Required | Description

| `yubikeyAPIClientID`
| false
| The client identifier used to identiy the application

| `yubikeyAPIKey`
| true
| The API key

| `priority`
| false
| The priority of the identity store

| `priorityExpression`
| false
| EL expression which overrides the priority value

| `yubikeyAPIClientIDExpression`
| false
| EL expression which overrides the yubikeyAPIClientID value
|===

These attributes can be overriden with MicroProfile configuration values:

. `payara.security.yubikey.apikey` overrides `yubikeyAPIKey`
. `payara.security.yubikey.clientid` overrides `yubikeyAPIClientID`
. `payara.security.yubikey.identitystore.priority` overrides `priority`
