== Supported APIs and Applications

* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 3.3
* Jakarta EE 8 Applications

*Notes*

In this release of Payara Enterprise we're unfortunately temporarily reverting an improvement we added in 5.21 - HTTP/2 support for JDK Native ALPN APIs (FISH-31). It has proved to be unstable in certain situations and so we've taken the decision to remove it from the Enterprise distributions until it's matured further - we were too quick to bring this feature in to Enterprise and apologise if this impacts you. This reversion means that HTTP/2 support will not work when using JDK 8u252 or higher (including JDK 11), and a warning will be printed in the log related to this. HTTP/2 should still work when using an older supported version of JDK 8 (8u162-8u242).
